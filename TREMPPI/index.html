    <div class="subtitle">Toolkit for Reverse Engineering of Molecular Pathways through Parameter Identification </div>
    <div class ="section">Introduction</div>
    <p>
        This the homepage of TREMPPI, a systems biology toolkit for research in gene regulation and molecular signalling. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This fully integrated, visual toolkit is well suited for the analysis of complex functional modules, e.g. circadian clock. 
        TREMPPI supports multiple ways of encoding various biological knowledge about the system. 
        The goal is to provide as much information as possible about how the structure of the system is likely to look. 
        Such an approach is most valuable if the precise mechanics of the module in question are not known. 
        In this scenario we simply consider all the possibilities for how the components of the module may interact and analyse them one by one. 
        This is a computationally very demanding task. To this end we are employing a coarse-grained modelling framework of logical networks, focusing solely on qualitative features of a model.

    <p>
        <span class="warning">TREMPPI is currently in Alpha version and the user experience is likely to be rough. 
            The developers bear no liability for any problems connected to using the software. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The easiest way of getting TREMPPI is via prebuild packages 
        <!--(if on Linux you get an error of the style "version 'LIBRARY_X.XX' not found", you can try upgrading the specified library via "apt-get install LIBRARY_X.XX").-->
    </p>

                <li>You also need the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46881">Visual Studio 2015</a> runtime, if you do not have it already.</li>
                <li>You also need <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.0/python-3.0.msi">Python3 32bit</a>. Lastly, the environment variable PYTHONPATH must point to the Python location.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If your system is not in the list, or the binary does not work 
        (in that case also please consider sharing your experience at esther<img src="/zavinac.png" width="10pt" />fi.muni.cz), 
        you can try building it from the <a href="https://github.com/xstreck1/TREMPPI">source at GITHUB</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="section">Usage</div>
    <p>
        TREMPPI has almost fully integrated graphical interface, however as of now some command line interaction is needed. 
        In this section we exaplain the basics of using tremppi.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Creating a project</div>
    <p>
        In the current version, TREMPPI is started from the command line and executed individually for each project.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make a new TREMPPI project, open terminal (cmd on Windows) and execute:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        PATH_TO_TREMPPI/tremppi init PROJECT_NAME
    </p>
    <p>
        Where PATH_TO_TREMPPI is the path to where TREMPPI is located on your system and PROJECT_NAME is the name of the project you want to create. 
        For example consider that on a Linux system you have TREMPPI in the directory software/TREMPPI and you want to create project called first_project. 
        Then call:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        ~/software/TREMPPI/tremppi init first_project
    </p>
    <p>
        This will create a new directory in the current location called "first_project". To open the project in TREMPPI then call:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        cd first_project <br />
        ~/software/TREMPPI/tremppi browse
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Workflow</div>
    <p>
        Once the GUI is started, a project is opened and the list of widgets is available. 
        Each of the widgets provides access to some part of the functionality of TREMPPI. 
        These are illustrated in detail in the following section, before that we illustrate the general workflow of TREMPPI step by step.    
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>editor: build the network by using the new button to create nodes (components) and edges (regulations).</li>
        <li>select: add new selection and check it (all the tools will now be applied to all models)</li>
        <li>tools: click on "spawn" to create a database of models.</li>
        <li>tools: you can now create labels. The labelling tools are:  
            <ul>
                <li>sign: each regulation in the network is assigned semantics - 
                    for inactive, + for activating, - for inhibiting, 1 for ambiguous.</li>
                <li>express: each model is expressed as a set of multi-valued logical equations in the form of Post Algebra.</li>
                <li>bias: for each component its bias is computed.</li>
                <li>impact: for each regulation its impact is computed.</li>
                <li>validate: this tool is dependent on the properties. 
                    For each selected property its Cost is computed, with optional Robustness and Witness computation.
                    This is detailed in the description of the properties widget.</li>
            </ul>  
        </li>
        <li>select: after executing a labelling tool, a set of new columns appears, relating to each of the labelled values
            (with the exception of the express tool).
            Specific selections can be created, as detailed in the description of the widget, for the purpose of statistical analysis.</li>
        <li>
            tools: based on the selection, on of the analytical tools can be executed:
            <ul>
                <li>correlations: creates a graph with correlations between the individual components in the sample.</li>
                <li>regulations: based on the impact infers a regulatory graph from the parametrizations set.</li>
                <li>qualitative: creates a summary for the qualitative labels in the selection.</li> 
                <li>quantitative: creates a summary for the quantitative labels in the selection.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>correlations, regulations, qualitative, quantitative: 
            each of the previous tools creates a report that can be viewed in the like-named widget.
            Open the widget and pick the selection by its name.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="subsection">Publishing</div>
    <p>
        Once it is finished, a project can be easily published on-line or shared without any further need for TREMPPI itself.
        To publish the project on a web, simply copy its folder to the target server, it will be immediately available.
        To share the project, copy the folder too, then it can be viewed in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the file "index.html" in a browser. 
            This way is not supported by the Google Chrome browser, due to security restrictions. 
            Possibly some other browsers also may cause problem.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start a local HTML server in the folder, e.g. if Python is available by the command "python SimpleHTTPServer".
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section">Widgets</div>
    <p>
        In this section we detail the individual widgets.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Index</div>
    <p>
        This is the entry point of a project. 
        The purpose of this widget is documentation.
        Write any comments about the project here, don't forget to use the "Save" button.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Editor</div>
    <p>
        The editor is the first step of using TREMPPI. 
        In the editor, the regulatory network and it's constraint are specified. 
        Once your work with the editor is finished, the network should no be anymore altered.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a component, click the "new" button and then empty space. 
        To create a regulation, click the "new" button and then first the source and then the target component.
        The component has a name and a maximum value.
        When you select a component, these appear on the top of the page, where the value can be replaced.
        Similarly, after selecting an edge, the threshold value and the edge label can be selected.
        The semantics of the regulatory network are described e.g. <a href="http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000002847/FIMU-RS-2012-03.pdf">in this article</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Select</div>
    <p>
        Selection is one of the core notions of TREMPPI.
        In the intuitive terms, selection is a condition each model must satisfy to be selected.
        This is used to label/analyse only certain models in the pool, which is crucial mainly for the analysis step.
        For each label that is available in the database, there is an option to create a selection condition. 
        First, click add to create a new selection and write a new name for it.
        Then for each field that is of an interest add the selection conditions. 
        There are three ways of doing so:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explicit value. By writing down an explicit number, you state that all models in the selection must have this label equal to this value.
            Use the decimal point for the values that are expected to be floating point values.
        </li> 
        <li>A range, e.g. (0.0,1.0], which states that the value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).</li>
        <li>A member of a list, for those values which provide the capability (e.g. sign). </li>   
    </ul>
    <p>
        All the selections that are checked on the (on the left) are applied in <b>disjunction</b>, 
        i.e. a model that meets any picked selections is going to be selected.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Properties</div>
    <p>
        Properties page is used to describe discrete formulas used by the validate tool.
        The widget is divided into two tables.
        The bottom table is used to describe the measurements.
        For each component, you can enter its exact value or a range of values in the given measurement.
        The delta value states what sort of change can the component undergo, 
        i.e. if it can go only up, down, or can not change at all in the steps from when the current measurement is entered until the next is entered.
        Note that each measurement has a letter assigned to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The upper table holds a list of properties.
        Each property has following components:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Name: this name is then referred to for the cost and robustness values.</li> 
        <li>Ending: represents how the model should behave after the last measurement. 
            This can be either left open (any value), or it may be required that it reaches a stable state, 
            or it may be required that from a certain point a measurement gets repeated. </li> 
        <li>V: check to conduct validation, produces the cost value.</li>
        <li>W: check to produce witness during validation (currently unused).</li>
        <li>R: check to computed robustness</li>
        <li>S: check to produce simulation trace from a witness (currently unused).</li>
        <li>Bound: currently unused.</li>
        <li>Name of the component: use a range or a specific value to fix this component to that value / range.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="subsection">Quantitative</div>
    <p>
        First of the reporting tools. 
        The select and compare buttons pick the data to load.
        All, Left, Mid, Right select which of the reports are going to be visible at a time.
        Each of the quantitative labels that is available at the time of creation of the report is depicted.
        The count value states how many entries attain a non-zero value.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Qualitative</div>
    <p>
        Similar to the quantitative report, however it displays rather how many different qualitative values there are and how big a portion of the selection they represent.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Regulations</div>
    <p>
        An inferred regulatory graph, describing the mean impact in the selection,
        together with the frequency value (how often does an edge has a non-zero sign) and the sign itself.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The relative button changes the scale for the values to the range of the values in the selection.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Correlations</div>
    <p>
        Similar to the regulations graph, only with the correlation instead of impact.
    </p>
    
    <div class="subsection">Tools</div>
    <p>
        This widget provides three panels. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first provides the list of tools, you can start a tool by clicking on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second shows currently running processes. You can stop them by clicking "kill all".
    </p>
    <p>
        The third show the log from the processes.
    </p>
