    <div class="title">TREMPPI 1.3.1</div>
    <div class="subtitle">Toolkit for Reverse Engineering of Molecular Pathways via Parameter Identification </div>
    <div class="subtitle">Last update: 28.02.2017</div>

    <div class ="section">Introduction</div>
    <p>
        This the homepage of TREMPPI, a systems biology toolkit for research in gene regulation and molecular signalling. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This fully integrated, visual toolkit is well suited for the analysis of complex functional modules, e.g. circadian clock. 
        TREMPPI supports multiple ways of encoding various biological knowledge about the system. 
        The goal is to provide as much information as possible about how the structure of the system is likely to look. 
        Such an approach is most valuable if the precise mechanics of the module in question are not known. 
        In this scenario we simply consider all the possibilities for how the components of the module may interact and analyse them one by one. 
        This is a computationally very demanding task. To this end we are employing a coarse-grained modelling framework of logical networks, focusing solely on qualitative features of a model.
        For an example of use see <a href="#thobe14a">[2]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a better perspective, you can examine a <a href="../demo_project/index.html">toy project</a>.
    </p>
    <div class ="section">Get TREMPPI</div>
    <p>
        The easiest way of getting TREMPPI is to download pre-built packages:
    </p>   
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/xstreck1/TREMPPI/archive/v1.3.0.tar.gz">Ubuntu/Debian 32bit</a> (preferred for Ubuntu)</li>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/xstreck1/TREMPPI/files/562247/TREMPPI.zip">Windows 32bit</a>
            <ul>
                <li>You also need the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">Visual Studio 2015</a> runtime, if you do not have it already.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>        
        For all systems you need the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> 
        and the <a href="TODO">Flask-user</a> package, which you can install via the <a href="TODO">PIP</a> package manage.
        <br />
        On Windows (also on Linux if it is in a non-standard location, the environment points to Python 2, etc.) <span class="warning">PYTHONHOME must point to Python 3 location</span>. 
        This can be achieved temporarily from a Unix terminal by calling:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        export PYTHONHOME=path_to_python3<br />
        path_to_TREMPPI/tremppi
    </p>
    <p>
        On Windows from the cmd tool by calling:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        set PYTHONHOME=path_to_python3<br />
        path_to_TREMPPI\tremppi.exe
    </p>
    <!--(if on Linux you get an error of the style "version 'LIBRARY_X.XX' not found", you can try upgrading the specified library via "apt-get install LIBRARY_X.XX").-->
    <p>
        If your system is not in the list, or the binary does not work 
        (in that case also please consider sharing your experience at tremppi.server<img src="./assets/zavinac.png" width="10pt" />gmail.com), 
        you can try building it from the <a href="https://github.com/xstreck1/TREMPPI">source at GITHUB</a>.

    </p>
    <p>   
        To update a project, open that project in TREMPPI and call the <span class="code">update</span> tool. <span class="warning">All the existing projects retain their original version until they are individually updated.</span>
    </p>
    <div class="section">Usage</div>
    In this section we go through some usage topics of TREMPPI. The complete reference is in the following section.

    <div class="subsection">Visual interface</div>
    <p>
        TREMPPI has a fully integrated graphical user interface that displays in a browser. 
        The tool is split into individual webpages, each providing access to a part of functionality of TREMPPI, however each of the pages is divided in the following four parts:
        <img src="./assets/UI.jpg" class="full_panel" alt="separation of the TREMPPI interface"/>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="lelem">MENU PANEL:</span> this panel provides user controls and top-level navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="lelem">PROJECT TREE:</span> shows the existing projects and their widgets and sub-files. 
            A left-click opens a project or widget, while a right-click provides a context menu that provides file-system like functions, like deletion, copying etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="lelem">WIDGET:</span> Widgets connect to TREMPPI directly, show the data and provide the analytical and statistical tools.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="lelem">LOG PANEL:</span> The bottom log panel displays the immediate info from TREMPPI and is related only to the web-page itself. 
            A green text shows info, an orange one warnings, and a red one errors.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection">Model creation</div>
    <p>
        For modelling we are using the Thomas Framework, as detailed in  <a href="#klarner12a">[3]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is composed of components (nodes) and regulations (edges).
        Each component <span class="math">v</span> has to have assigned to it a maximum activity level value, denoted <span class="math">&rho;(v)</span>, 
        meaning that <span class="math">v</span> can occur in a state between <span class="math">0</span> and <span class="math">&rho;(v)</span>.
        Also each regulation takes on a value, here called threshold.
        The regulation is then active only once the state of the component is higher or equal to the threshold.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Once the network is finished, the next step is to enumerate all the models fitting the network. 
        This is done via the <span class="code">spawn</span> tool. 
        This tool considers all possible regulatory function for each component and enumerates all possible combinations thereof.
    </p>

    <div class="subsection">Labels</div>
    <p>
        After the models are enumerated, each of them can be labelled for various properties. In particular, there are the following labels:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class='math'>K<sub>v</sub>(&omega;) &isin; [0,&rho;(v)]</span> 
            is the parameter value for the component <span class='math'>v</span> in the context (a set of states fitting the configuration) <span class='math'>&omega;</span>.
            The symbol <span class='math'>&rho;(v)</span> denotes the maximum activity of <span class='math'>v</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class='math'>bias(v) &isin; [0.0,1.0]</span> 
            denotes how much is the component <span class='math'>v</span> biased towards the lower or higher activity levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class='math'>impact(u,t,v) &isin; [-1.0,1.0]</span> 
            denotes how prominent is the regulation <span class='math'>(u,t,v)</span>.
            Values close to <span class='math'>-1.0</span> denote a strong inhibition, 
            the ones close to <span class='math'>0.0</span> denote weak effect,
            and the ones close to <span class='math'>1.0</span> denote a strong activation. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class='math'>sign(u,t,v) &isin; {0,+,-,1}</span> 
            is the sign of the  <span class='math'>(u,t,v)</span>. 
            The value <span class='math'>0</span> denotes no effect, 
            the value <span class='math'>+</span> activation, 
            the value <span class='math'>-</span> inhibition,
            and the value <span class='math'>1</span> activation and inhibition at once.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class='math'>cost(property) &isin; [0,2147483648]</span> 
            denotes how many simulation steps it takes to satisfy the <span class='math'>property</span> (see the following section for details).
            The lower the better, however the special value <span class='math'>0</span> means it is not possible at all.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class='math'>robustness(property) &isin; [0.0,1.0]</span> 
            denotes how probably it is that the <span class='math'>property</span> is satisfied.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection">Model checking</div>
    <p>
        We employ a custom LTL model checking procedure for dynamical analysis <a href="#streck15b">[5]</a>.
        Through the <span class='code'>properties</span> widget one can specify a list of properties, which can be tested on the parametrizations.
        There are three model checking functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class='lelem'>cost:</span> creates the <span class='math'>cost(property)</span> label for each selected <span class='math'>property</span>. If the label value is non-zero, the property is satisfied.</li>
        <li><span class='lelem'>robustness:</span> creates the <span class='math'>robustness(property)</span> label.</li>
        <li><span class='lelem'>trace:</span> stores the traces for satisfiable properties. There are not listed anywhere, but are used and required by the witness tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="quater_fig">
        <img src="./assets/open_STG.png" class="fig" alt="demonstration of an open ending"/>
        <p>A transition system of 4 Boolean components. 
            A path of <span class='math'>cost = 3</span> for the property with <span class='math'>M1 = (1,1,1,*)</span> and <span class='math'>M2 = (*,0,0,*)</span> and <span class='math'>open</span> ending.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater_fig">
        <img src="./assets/stable_STG.png" class="fig" alt="demonstration of a stable ending"/>
        <p>The same property as on the left, however this time with the <span class='math'>stable</span> ending.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater_fig">
        <img src="./assets/cyclic_STG.png" class="fig" alt="demonstration of a cyclic ending"/>
        <p>The same property as on the left, however this time with the <span class='math'>cyclic</span> ending.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="quater_fig">
        <img src="./assets/monotone_STG.png" class="fig" alt="demonstration of monotonicity ending"/>
        <p>The property <span class='math'>M1 = (1,1,0,1)</span>, <span class='math'>M2 = (1,0,0,*)</span>, and <span class='math'>M3 = (0,0,0,1)</span> 
            and monotonicity in all components.
            The red path shows a trace that will not be accepted, because the fourth component is not monotonous between <span class='math'>M2)</span> and <span class='math'>M3</span>.
            The green path is monotonous and will be accepted.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">Command line</div>
    <p>   
        Each of the individual tools of TREMPPI can be executed from the command line. To see the available commands, call
    </p>
    <p class="code">tremppi --help</p>
    <p>   
        Each of the commands can be then executed by calling:
    </p>
    <p class="code">tremppi command [--path path_to_project]</p>
    <p>   
        where <span class="code">command</span> is the requested command, and <span class="code">path_to_project</span> is the system path to the project where the tool should be called.
        If no path is specified, the current directory is used.
    </p>
    <p>   
        Lastly to create a new project from the command line, call
    </p>
    <p class="code">tremppi init project_name [--path path_to_folder]</p>   

    <p> 
        where <span class="code">project_name</span> is the name of the new project and <span class="code">path_to_folder</span> is the location where the project should be created.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Project structure</div>
    <p>
        By default, TREMPPI uses the <span class="code">projects</span> folder in its home folder to store the projects. 
        This is where <span class="code">project_0</span> is created upon the start of the tool and where all the project data are stored.
    </p><p>
        By default, the project folder also contains multiple projects. 
        It is however possible to use and distribute projects individually. 
        To this end, TREMPPI can be started from the command line with the command <span class="code">tremppi browse --path project_path</span> 
        where <span class="code">project_path</span> points to the location of the project of interest.
        In this case TREMPPI will be started in the single-project mode.
    </p><p>   
        If <span class="code">project_path</span> does not point to a folder with a project, but to a folder that holds at least one folder with a TREMPPI project,
        then TREMPPI will be started in the normal mode, however <span class="code">project_path</span> will replace the default <span class="code">projects</span> folder.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Publishing</div>
    <p>
        Once it is finished, a project can be easily published on-line or shared without any further need for TREMPPI itself.
        To do so, first remove unnecessary data by pressing the <span class="code">FINALIZE</span> button.
        <span class="warning">Caution, this is an irreversible action and will make the project immutable.
            If you want to continue to work on your project, clone it first. </span>
        After that, navigate to the <span class="code">projects</span> folder---you can distribute the project by copying the containing folder.
        To view the project, you do not need TREMPPI anymore, and can use one of the following approaches.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Copy the project onto an existing HTTP server, e.g. you University homepage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start a local HTML server in the project folder. 
            If Python 2 is available, this can be done by the command <span class="code">python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</span>.
            If Python 3 is available, then by the command <span class="code">python -m http.server 8080</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Open the file  <span class="code">index.html</span> in a browser. 
            This way is not supported by the Google Chrome browser, due to security restrictions. 
            Other browsers may also cause problem.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that a finalized project does not contain any project managements tools anymore, therefore, if the user wishes to remove the project, it must be erased from the system manually.
    </p>

    <div class="subsection">Tables</div>
    <p>
        Some of the widgets (select, properties) feature editable tables. 
        There is a joint control scheme for the tables, and the following buttons are always available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="code">&darr;</span> Currently selected row(s) is/are moved down a single row.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="code">&uarr;</span> Currently selected row(s) is/are moved up a single row.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="code">Add</span> Creates a new row at the end of the table.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="code">Duplicate</span> Currently selected row(s) is/are duplicated.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="code">Delete</span> Currently selected row(s) is/are erased.
        </li>
    </ul>
    In the case there is an option to select elements, i.e. each row has a checkbox as its first element, there is an additional button:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="code">All</span> Select (click once) or deselect (click twice) all the rows.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section">Reference</div>

    <div class="subsection">Project tree</div>
    <p>
        Project Tree has four levels of depth, each with it's unique features:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="lelem">Projects:</span>The top-level tab is called projects and is used for creation of new projects. It has two options:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lelem">new project: </span>Creates a new project from scratch. Will be called <span class="code">project_0</span> or a higher index if this is taken.</li>
                <li><span class="lelem">upload: </span>Allows to upload a project in the <span class="code">.zip</span> format.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Project:</span>The individual project's folder. In here all the data relating to a single project are stored. It has multiple options:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lelem">open: </span>Opens the project in the current widget.</li>
                <li><span class="lelem">clone: </span>Creates a deep copy of the project named <span class="code">project(clone)</span></li>
                <li><span class="lelem">rename: </span>Assigns a new name to the project.</li>
                <li><span class="lelem">delete: </span>Removes the project.</li>
                <li><span class="lelem">finalize: </span>Removes the background (not visible to user) data from the project and prohibits further analyses. The reports stay untouched. This usually reduced the size of the project to a fraction and is useful when you want to distribute your results.</li>
                <li><span class="lelem">download: </span>Makes a zip archive that can be uploaded to another instance of TREMPPI.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Widget:</span>A specific project widget. This can be either a single page, or a collection of files.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lelem">open: </span>Opens the selected widget for the current project.</li>
                <li><span class="lelem">save: </span>
                    TREMPPI saves files automatically when exiting current widget. 
                    However to be secure against e.g. system crash, you can call that manually. 
                    Available only on the currently open widget.
                </li>
                <li><span class="lelem">save: </span>
                    TREMPPI saves files automatically when exiting current widget. 
                    However to be secure against e.g. system crash, you can call that manually. 
                    Available only on the currently open widget.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Report file:</span>For reporting widgets, like <span class="code">qualitative</span> these are the specific report files.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lelem">open: </span>Opens the selected file.</li>
                <li><span class="lelem">compare: </span>Creates a report comparison between the opened file and the selected file.</li>

                <li><span class="lelem">delete: </span>Removes the file.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="subsection">Index</div>
    <p>
        This is the entry point of a project. 
        The purpose of this widget is purely for documentation.
    <div class="subsection">Editor</div>
    <p>
        The editor is used to create the regulatory network, see <a href="#klarner12a">[3]</a> for details. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create a component, click the <span class='code'>new</span> button and then empty space.</li>
        <li>To create a regulation, click the <span class='code'>new</span> button, then the source component and lastly the target component.</li>
        <li>The component has a Name and a Maximal Activity Level.
            When you select a component, these appear on the top of the page, where the value can be replaced.</li>
        <li>Similarly, after selecting an edge, the Threshold value and the edge Label can be selected. The meaning of the labels is explained in detail in <a href="#klarner14a">[4]</a>.</li>
		<li>For multi-valued models, the <span class='code'>Apply Normalization</span> feature can be used to remove duplicities of the same model. See <a href="#streck15c">[6]</a> for reference.</li>
    </ul>
    Note that the changes are applied to graph only after the enter button is pressed.
    <div class="subsection">Select</div>
    <p>
        Selection is one of the core notions of TREMPPI.
        In the intuitive terms, selection is a condition each model must satisfy to be selected.
        This is used to label/analyse only certain models in the pool, which is crucial mainly for the analysis step.
        For each label that is available in the database, there is an option to create a selection condition. 
        First, click add to create a new selection and write a new name for it.
        Then for each label that is of an interest add the selection conditions. 
        There are multiple different expressions one can write in a selection field. In the following we will use the symbol <span class="code">l</span> to denote a label: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <span class="code">X</span> either an integer or a floating point number with delimited by the dot symbol (<span class="code">.</span>). 
            In such a case, all parametrizations must have the value of the label, i.e. it is required that <span class="code">l = X</span>.
            For example we can require that <span class="code">K<sub>A</sub>(0) = 0</span> or that <span class="code">bias(A) = 0.5</span>.
        </li>
        <li> <span class="code">!X</span> is an addition to the condition (1) that states its opposite, i.e. <span class="code">l &ne; X</span> in all the parametrizations.
        </li>
        <li> <span class="code">(X,Y)</span> where <span class="code">X</span> and <span class="code">Y</span> are numbers as explained in (1).
            Here we require the value to be in the given range with the boundaries not lying in the range. 
            E.g. <span class="code">(0,1)</span> means that <span class="code">l &gt; 0</span> and <span class="code">l &lt; 0</span>.
        </li>
        <li> <span class="code">[X,Y)</span>, or <span class="code">(X,Y]</span>, or <span class="code">(X,Y)</span> is the same as (3) but the values after square bracket belong to the range.
            E.g. <span class="code">[0.5,1]</span> means that <span class="code">l &ge; 0.5</span> and <span class="code">l &le; 0</span>.
        </li>
        <li> <span class="code">!(X,Y)</span>, or <span class="code">![X,Y)</span>, or <span class="code">!(X,Y]</span>, or <span class="code">!(X,Y)</span> negates the elements of (3) and (4).
            E.g. <span class="code">!(4,6]</span> means that either <span class="code">l &le; 4</span> or <span class="code">l &gt; 6</span>.
        </li>
        <li> <span class="code">(X,)</span> and <span class="code">[X,)</span> are one-sided intervals with and without inclusion of <span class="code">X</span>, respectively.
            E.g. <span class="code">(0,)</span> means all values greater than zero. Square bracket can be used as closing one without any change to the semantics.
        </li>
        <li> <span class="code">(,X)</span> and <span class="code">(,X]</span> are the right-sided equivalent of (6).
        </li>
        <li> The sign label is an exception and is provided with a selection of one of four elements: <span class="code">{0,+,-,1}</span>. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        All the selections that are checked on the (on the left) are applied in <b>disjunction</b>, 
        i.e. a model that meets any picked selections is going to be selected.
    </p>

    <div class="subsection">Properties</div>
    <p>
        Properties page is used to describe discrete formulas used by the validate tool.
        The widget is divided into two tables, the top one holds the list of properties, the bottom one the details for a selected property. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The upper table has the following columns:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="lelem">Name:</span> this name is then referred to for the <span class="math">cost</span> and <span class="math">robustness</span> values.</li> 
        <li><span class="lelem">Ending:</span> represents how the model should behave after the last measurement. 
            This can be either left open (<span class='code'>any</span>), or it may be required that it reaches a stable state (<span class='code'>any</span>), 
            or it may be required that from a certain point a measurement gets repeated (<span class='code'>goto x</span>),
            where (<span class='code'>x</span>) is the letter of the measurement that should be repeated, see below.

        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Component setup (denoted by the name of each component):</span> use a range or a specific value to fix this component to that range or value.
            This field is simpler than the one for the selection, in particular only integer values are allowed and only a single value or a closed range is allowed, i.e. the options 1,3,4 from Section 4.3.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        After clicking on a specific property in the upper table, its details are listed in the lower table. The columns are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="lelem">Id:</span> the index of the measurement. Note that the order of measurements is enforced in the model checking and therefore the order in this table matters.</li> 
        <li><span class="lelem">Value:</span> the level(s) of the specific component in the measurement. As with the setup, only an integer or integer range is allowed here.</li> 
        <li><span class="lelem">Delta:</span> the monotonicity/transitivity requirement for the component. The value can be:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="code"></span> no requirement,</li>
                <li><span class="code">stay:</span> the component must not change its value until the next measurement,</li>
                <li><span class="code">up:</span> the component must not decrease until the next measurement,</li>
                <li><span class="code">stay:</span> the component must not increase until the next measurement.</li>
            </ul>
            For details see <a href="#streck15b">[5]</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="subsection">Reports:</div>
    There are currently 5 reporting widgets available. 
    As a reminder, each widget has a list of reports displayed in the control panel and three panes: the left selection, the comparison, and the right selection.
    The left selection is populated by a left click, the right by a right click and the comparison is created automatically. 
    The comparison shows the results of the difference (left - right), tailored to each of the widgets.
    <ol>
        <li><span class="lelem">Quantitative:</span> this report provides the basic quantitative information, i.e. summary about numerical values. In particular there are 5 fields:
            <ol>
                <li>Label: the label and its parameters for this row.</li>
                <li>Count: how often, in the selection, has the label a non-zero value.</li> 
                <li>Min: the minimal value in the selection.</li> 
                <li>Max: the maximal value in the selection.</li> 
                <li>Mean: the mean of the selection.</li> 
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Qualitative:</span> this report provides the basic qualitative information, i.e. summary about categorical (and sparse numerical) values. There are only three fields:
            <ol>
                <li>Label: the label and its parameters for this row.</li>
                <li>#: how many distinct values appear in the selection.</li> 
                <li>Elements: what portion of the selection each value occupies.</li> 
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Regulations:</span>  
            this is a graph-based report which re-creates the network made in the editor.
            The mean <span class="math">impact</span> in the selection is projected to the colour of the regulation,
            while the width of a regulation is obtained from its <span class="math">frequency</span> (i.e. how often it takes on a non-zero value).
            For the non-positive <span class="math">frequency</span>, the 0 value is displayed dotted and a negative value as dashed. 
            Both the values have their legend on the bottom. 
            Lastly, the arrow head is set as the most specific <span class="math">sign</span> fitting all the parametrizations. I.e. if all regulations are non-function, it is a circle. If none are negative,
            it is a pointed arrow, if none are positive, it is a blunt arrow, otherwise it is combination of the two.
            There is also an additional button:
            <ol>
                <li>Relative: normalize the values in the current report to the boundaries. If all the values are zero, there is no change made.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Correlations:</span>  
            a second graph-based report. Here the <span class="math">bias</span> of a component is projected to the width of a frame, again full for positive, dotted for 0, and dashed for negative.
            Additionally <span class="math">correlation</span> between <span class="math">bias</span> is computed and displayed as a colour gradient edge between the correlated components.
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Group:</span> 
            The Group feature is another tool to examine groups of parametrizations. 
            The group feature creates mutually disjoint sets of parametrizations that match on all they features.
            The two parametrizations are considered matching if and only if:
            <ol>
                <li>For each two corresponding regulations those are either <span class="code">0</span> or <span class="code">!0</span>.</li>
                <li>For each of the currently selected properties, the <span class="math">cost</span> is either  <span class="code">0</span> or <span class="code">!0</span>.</li>              
            </ol>
            For each of the sets, the values of all of these features are displayed.
            The value <span class="code">!0</span> is displayed as <span class="code">1</span>.
            If the value is completely absent, it is displayed as <span class="code">*</span>.
            Lastly, the user can turn features on or off. 
            If a feature is of, the groups that differ only in this feature will be merged.

        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Witness:</span> 
            for a parametrization to satisfy a property, it is required that there exists a path in the transition system that proves that the property is satisfiable.
            This path is called a <span class="math">witness</span>.
            The witness report provides all the witnesses with the minimal cost, for all the properties selected at once.
            The witness is constituted from states, which show what is the current configuration of the components and what is the currently satisfied measurement.
            The transitions have width dependent on how often they occur in the traces for any parametrization and any property, i.e. the value is 1 if the transition is present in
            trace for every parametrization and every property. Additionally, each transition has a number stating what is the order of that transition in the witness. 
            The report has again the relative button, projecting the width of the edges to normalized boundaries.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="subsection">Tools: computational tools</div>
    <p>
        There are currently 5 classes of tools:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="lelem">Enumeration:</span>
            The <span class="code">enumerate</span> tool takes the network definition from the <span class="code">editor</span> and creates the model pool necessary for all the following tools.
            The <span class="code">erase</span> erases the model pool, also erasing also the labels, properties, selections, and the follow-up data. Makes the editor interactive again.
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Static Labels:</span> the tools that label the individual models based on the parameter values. These are fast to compute.</li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Properties:</span>
            The <span class="code">freeze</span> tool finalises the definition of the properties and enables the selection tool.
            The <span class="code">unfreeze</span> tool enables editing of the properties, also erasing the selections, dynamic lables, and the follow-up data.
        </li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Dynamic Labels:</span> the tools that label the individual models based on the properties. These are slow to compute.</li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Reports:</span> the statistical analysis tools.</li>
        <li><span class="lelem">Utility:</span> three additional tools for maintenance. 
            The <span class="code">update</span> tool updates the current project to the latest available version.
            The <span class="code">configure</span> tool refreshes the configuration of the widgets, mainly the columns of the individual tables, which however should always happen automatically.
            The <span class="code">clean</span> this tool removes all the computed data.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        There are execution dependences between the tools as illustrated by the following graph:
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/dependencies.png" class="full_panel" alt="dependency graph of the tools" />
    <p>
        Additionally there are two additional panels, one for current progress and the other with log history.
    </p>
    <p>
        The progress panel displays the active tool and the list of tools batched for execution across all the projects. This panel is updated every second.
        It also allows to kill all the process at once by pressing the relevant button.
    </p>
    <p>
        The log panel displays the log history for the tools on the current project.
    </p>
    <!--
        <li>sign: each regulation in the network is assigned semantics - 
            for inactive, + for activating, - for inhibiting, 1 for ambiguous.</li>
        <li>express: each model is expressed as a set of multi-valued logical equations in the form of Post Algebra.</li>
        <li>bias: for each component its bias is computed.</li>
        <li>impact: for each regulation its impact is computed.</li>
        <li>validate: this tool is dependent on the properties. 
            For each selected property its cost is computed, with optional robustness and Witness computation.
            This is detailed in the description of the properties widget.</li>
        <li>correlations: creates a graph with correlations between the individual components in the sample.</li>
        <li>regulations: based on the impact infers a regulatory graph from the parametrizations set.</li>
        <li>qualitative: creates a summary for the qualitative labels in the selection.</li> 
        <li>quantitative: creates a summary for the quantitative labels in the selection.</li>
