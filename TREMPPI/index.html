    <div class="subtitle">Toolkit for Reverse Engineering of Molecular Pathways through Parameter Identification </div>
    <div class ="section">Introduction</div>
    <p>
        This the homepage of TREMPPI, a systems biology toolkit for research in gene regulation and molecular signalling. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This fully integrated, visual toolkit is well suited for the analysis of complex functional modules, e.g. circadian clock. 
        TREMPPI supports multiple ways of encoding various biological knowledge about the system. 
        The goal is to provide as much information as possible about how the structure of the system is likely to look. 
        Such an approach is most valuable if the precise mechanics of the module in question are not known. 
        In this scenario we simply consider all the possibilities for how the components of the module may interact and analyse them one by one. 
        This is a computationally very demanding task. To this end we are employing a coarse-grained modelling framework of logical networks, focusing solely on qualitative features of a model.
        For an example of use see <a href="#thobe14a">[2]</a>.
    </p>
    <div class ="section">Download & Execution</div>
    <p>
        <span class="warning">TREMPPI is currently in Alpha version and the user experience is likely to be rough. 
            The developers bear no liability for any problems connected to using the software. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The easiest way of getting TREMPPI is via pre-built packages:
    </p>   
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/TREMPPI/build/TREMPPI_Ubuntu32.tar.gz">Ubuntu/Debian 32bit</a> (preferred for Ubuntu)</li>
        <li><a href="/TREMPPI/build/TREMPPI_Debian64.tar.gz">Ubuntu/Debian 64bit</a> (preferred for Debian)</li>
        <li><a href="/TREMPPI/build/TREMPPI_Windows32.zip">Windows 32bit</a>
            <ul>
                <li>You also need the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46881">Visual Studio 2015</a> runtime, if you do not have it already.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>        
        For all systems you need the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a>. 
        On Windows (also on Linux if it is in a non-standard location, the environment points to Python 2, etc.) <span class="warning">PYTHONHOME must point to Python 3 location</span>. 
        This can be achieved temporarily from a Unix terminal by calling:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        export PYTHONHOME=path_to_python3<br />
        path_to_TREMPPI/tremppi
    </p>
    <p>
        On Windows from the cmd tool by calling:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        set PYTHONHOME=path_to_python3<br />
        path_to_TREMPPI/tremppi
    </p>
        <!--(if on Linux you get an error of the style "version 'LIBRARY_X.XX' not found", you can try upgrading the specified library via "apt-get install LIBRARY_X.XX").-->
    <p>
        If your system is not in the list, or the binary does not work 
        (in that case also please consider sharing your experience at esther<img src="/zavinac.png" width="10pt" />fi.muni.cz), 
        you can try building it from the <a href="https://github.com/xstreck1/TREMPPI">source at GITHUB</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="section">Tutorial</div>
    <p>
        TREMPPI has a fully integrated graphical user interface that displays in a browser. 
        It can be used in the same manner as any other webpage. 
        Once the GUI is started, a project is opened and the list of widgets is available. 
        Each of the widgets provides access to some part of the functionality of TREMPPI. 
        These are illustrated in detail in the following section, before that we illustrate the general workflow of TREMPPI step by step.    
    </p>    
    <p>
        In this section we present a toy example to demonstrate the key concepts of TREMPPI:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>START TREMPPI: The tool can be started either by double-clicking on the executable named <i>tremppi</i> or from the command line by executing the command from the directory in which it resides.
            Note that if there is an error stating that a python module is missing, the PYTHONHOME needs to be set as explained above.
        </li>
        <li>
            OPEN A PROJECT: TREMPPI starts with a single project opened on start, called <i>project_0</i>, residing in the list of projects on the left.
            Underneath you can find a list of widgets available to each project.
            The entry point of each project is the "index" widget. 
            Open it by left-click.
            After opening, you will see a panel with description of the project, which is empty as of now.
            Write arbitrary text to this windows for now, e.g. "Hello World".
            After writing the text, click the <i>SAVE</i> button in the bottom-left corner. 
            This will result in your text being stored within the project data files.
            On the bottom black-line you should see the text "index has saved successfully" as a confirmation.
            You can also observe that your text has been saved by pressing the reload button (usually F5). 
            After the page reloads, your text should appear again.
        </li>
        <li>BUILD A MODEL: Open the <i>editor</i> widget. Click the <i>Add</i> button on the top and then the grey area underneath.
            A new component will appear. 
            Repeat. 
            Once you have two components, click add again, then one component, then the other. 
            A regulation between the two appears.
            Lastly click a component. 
            Its name and maximal value appears on the top panel. 
            Write a name instead of the generic <i>New</i> and confirm with enter.
            The name in the graph changes as well.
            Repeat also for the second component and lastly click the <i>SAVE</i> button.
        </li>
        <li>ENUMERATE PARAMETERS: Open the <i>tools</i> widged and click the <i>spawn</i> button.</li>
        <li>GET BASIC STATISTICS: Click the <i>qualitative</i> and <i>quantitative</i> buttons.
        <li>READ THE STATISTICS: Click the <i>qualitative</i> or <i>quantitative</i> widget on the left. 
            A new category, called <i>files</i>, appears with a single element, called <i>all</i>.
            Left click it to gain basic knowledge about the parametrization space, concluding your introduction to TREMPPI.
    </ol>

    <div class="subsection">Publishing</div>
    <p>
        Once it is finished, a project can be easily published on-line or shared without any further need for TREMPPI itself.
        To publish the project on a web, simply copy its folder to the target server, it will be immediately available.
        To share the project, copy the folder too, then it can be viewed in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the file "index.html" in a browser. 
            This way is not supported by the Google Chrome browser, due to security restrictions. 
            Possibly some other browsers also may cause problem.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start a local HTML server in the folder, e.g. if Python is available by the command "python SimpleHTTPServer".
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section">Reference</div>
    <p>
        In this section we detail the individual widgets.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Index</div>
    <p>
        This is the entry point of a project. 
        The purpose of this widget is documentation and project manipulation.
        If TREMPPI is started in folder of a particular project, only the <i>SAVE</i> button is available.
        If TREMPPI is started in a folder containing folders of other projects, then the following project controls are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>NAME FIELD:</i> Enter a new name into this field to rename the project.</li>
        <li><i>CLONE:</i> Creates a new project with the exact contents of this one.</li>
        <li><i>RENAME:</i> Changes the name of the project.</li>
        <li><i>DELETE:</i> Removes the project and all its data.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="subsection">Editor</div>
    <p>
        The editor is used to create the regulatory network, see <a href="#klarner12a">[3]</a> for details. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create a component, click the <i>NEW</i> button and then empty space.</li>
        <li>To create a regulation, click the <i>NEW</i> button, then the source component and lastly the target component.</li>
        <li>The component has a Name and a Maximal Activity Level.
        When you select a component, these appear on the top of the page, where the value can be replaced.</li>
        <li>Similarly, after selecting an edge, the Threshold value and the edge Label can be selected. The meaning of the labels is explained in detail in <a href="#klarner14a">[4]</a></li>.
    </ul>
    Note that the changes are applied to graph only after the enter button is pressed.
    <div class="subsection">Select</div>
    <p>
        Selection is one of the core notions of TREMPPI.
        In the intuitive terms, selection is a condition each model must satisfy to be selected.
        This is used to label/analyse only certain models in the pool, which is crucial mainly for the analysis step.
        For each label that is available in the database, there is an option to create a selection condition. 
        First, click add to create a new selection and write a new name for it.
        Then for each field that is of an interest add the selection conditions. 
        There are three ways of doing so:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explicit value. By writing down an explicit number, you state that all models in the selection must have this label equal to this value.
            Use the decimal point for the values that are expected to be floating point values.
        </li> 
        <li>A range, e.g. (0.0,1.0], which states that the value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).</li>
        <li>A member of a list, for those values which provide the capability (e.g. sign). </li>   
    </ul>
    <p>
        All the selections that are checked on the (on the left) are applied in <b>disjunction</b>, 
        i.e. a model that meets any picked selections is going to be selected.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Properties</div>
    <p>
        Properties page is used to describe discrete formulas used by the validate tool.
        The widget is divided into two tables.
        The bottom table is used to describe the measurements.
        For each component, you can enter its exact value or a range of values in the given measurement.
        The delta value states what sort of change can the component undergo, 
        i.e. if it can go only up, down, or can not change at all in the steps from when the current measurement is entered until the next is entered.
        Note that each measurement has a letter assigned to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The upper table holds a list of properties.
        Each property has following components:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Name: this name is then referred to for the cost and robustness values.</li> 
        <li>Ending: represents how the model should behave after the last measurement. 
            This can be either left open (any value), or it may be required that it reaches a stable state, 
            or it may be required that from a certain point a measurement gets repeated. </li>
        <li>Bound: currently unused.</li>
        <li>Name of the component: use a range or a specific value to fix this component to that value / range.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="subsection">Quantitative</div>
    <p>
        First of the reporting tools. 
        The select and compare buttons pick the data to load.
        All, Left, Mid, Right select which of the reports are going to be visible at a time.
        Each of the quantitative labels that is available at the time of creation of the report is depicted.
        The count value states how many entries attain a non-zero value.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Qualitative</div>
    <p>
        Similar to the quantitative report, however it displays rather how many different qualitative values there are and how big a portion of the selection they represent.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Regulations</div>
    <p>
        An inferred regulatory graph, describing the mean impact in the selection,
        together with the frequency value (how often does an edge has a non-zero sign) and the sign itself.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The relative button changes the scale for the values to the range of the values in the selection.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection">Correlations</div>
    <p>
        Similar to the regulations graph, only with the correlation instead of impact.
    </p>
    
    <div class="subsection">Tools</div>
    <p>
        This widget provides three panels. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first provides the list of tools, you can start a tool by clicking on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second shows currently running processes. You can stop them by clicking "kill all".
    </p>
    <p>
        The third show the log from the processes.
    </p>
    
            <!--
                <li>sign: each regulation in the network is assigned semantics - 
                    for inactive, + for activating, - for inhibiting, 1 for ambiguous.</li>
                <li>express: each model is expressed as a set of multi-valued logical equations in the form of Post Algebra.</li>
                <li>bias: for each component its bias is computed.</li>
                <li>impact: for each regulation its impact is computed.</li>
                <li>validate: this tool is dependent on the properties. 
                    For each selected property its Cost is computed, with optional Robustness and Witness computation.
                    This is detailed in the description of the properties widget.</li>
                <li>correlations: creates a graph with correlations between the individual components in the sample.</li>
                <li>regulations: based on the impact infers a regulatory graph from the parametrizations set.</li>
                <li>qualitative: creates a summary for the qualitative labels in the selection.</li> 
                <li>quantitative: creates a summary for the quantitative labels in the selection.</li>
