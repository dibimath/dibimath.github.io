<div class="subtitle">Toolkit for Reverse Engineering of Molecular Pathways through Parameter Identification </div>
<div class ="section">Introduction</div>
<p>
    This the homepage of TREMPPI, a systems biology toolkit for research in gene regulation and molecular signalling. 
</p>
<p>
    This fully integrated, visual toolkit is well suited for the analysis of complex functional modules, e.g. circadian clock. 
    TREMPPI supports multiple ways of encoding various biological knowledge about the system. 
    The goal is to provide as much information as possible about how the structure of the system is likely to look. 
    Such an approach is most valuable if the precise mechanics of the module in question are not known. 
    In this scenario we simply consider all the possibilities for how the components of the module may interact and analyse them one by one. 
    This is a computationally very demanding task. To this end we are employing a coarse-grained modelling framework of logical networks, focusing solely on qualitative features of a model.

<p>
    <span class="warning">TREMPPI is currently in Alpha version and the user experience is likely to be rough. 
        The developers bear no liability for any problems connected to using the software. </span>
</p>
<p>
    The easiest way of getting TREMPPI is via prebuild packages 
    <!--(if on Linux you get an error of the style "version 'LIBRARY_X.XX' not found", you can try upgrading the specified library via "apt-get install LIBRARY_X.XX").-->
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/TREMPPI/build/TREMPPI_Ubuntu32.tar.gz">Ubuntu/Debian 32bit</a> (preferred for Ubuntu)</li>
    <li><a href="/TREMPPI/build/TREMPPI_Debian64.tar.gz">Ubuntu/Debian 64bit</a> (preferred for Debian)</li>
    <li><a href="/TREMPPI/build/TREMPPI_Windows32.zip">Windows 32bit</a>
        <ul>
            <li>You also need the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46881">Visual Studio 2015</a> runtime, if you do not have it already.</li>
            <li>You also need <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.0/python-3.0.msi">Python3 32bit</a>. Lastly, the environment variable PYTHONPATH must point to the Python location.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If your system is not in the list, or the binary does not work 
    (in that case also please consider sharing your experience at esther<img src="zavinac.png" width="10pt" />fi.muni.cz), 
    you can try building it from the <a href="https://github.com/xstreck1/TREMPPI">source at GITHUB</a>.

<div class="section">Usage</div>
<p>
TREMPPI has almost fully integrated graphical interface, however as of now some command line interaction is needed. 
In this section we exaplain the basics of using tremppi.
</p>
<div class="subsection">Creating a project</div>
<p>
    In the current version, TREMPPI is started from the command line and executed individually for each project.
</p>
<p>
    To make a new TREMPPI project, open terminal (cmd on Windows) and execute:
</p>
<p class="code">
    PATH_TO_TREMPPI/tremppi init PROJECT_NAME
</p>
<p>
    Where PATH_TO_TREMPPI is the path to where TREMPPI is located on your system and PROJECT_NAME is the name of the project you want to create. 
    For example consider that on a Linux system you have TREMPPI in the directory software/TREMPPI and you want to create project called first_project. 
    Then call:
</p>
<p class="code">
    ~/software/TREMPPI/tremppi init first_project
</p>
<p>
    This will create a new directory in the current location called "first_project". To open the project in TREMPPI then call:
</p>
<p class="code">
    cd first_project <br />
    ~/software/TREMPPI/tremppi browse
</p>
<div class="subsection">Workflow</div>
<p>
    Once the GUI is started, a project is opened and the list of widgets is available. 
    Each of the widgets provides access to some part of the functionality of TREMPPI. 
    These are illustrated in detail in the following section, before that we illustrate the general workflow of TREMPPI step by step.    
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Editor: build the model by using the new button to create nodes and edges.</li>
    <li>Select: add new selection and check it (all the tools will now be applied to all models)</li>
    <li>Tools: click on "spawn" to create a database of parametrizations.</li>
    <li>Tools: you can now use bias, sign, express, impact and validate.</li>

    
</ol>
