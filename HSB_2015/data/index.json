	"text": "This is supplementary information for HSB 2015 submission \"Comparative Statistical Analysis of Qualitative Parametrization Sets\". The content is as follows:\n\nEditor:\nRegulatory graph of the toy network, contains components A, B and three regulations. The threshold values are displayed on the edges.\n\nSelect:\nThe two selection used for generating reports in the paper. One selects all possible parametrizations, the other the subset which has Cost of the property p (see below) at 4, Robustness at 1 and the self-regulation on B inactive.\n\nProperties:\nThe property p requires that there is an asynchronous path in the state space of the model that leads from the state (A=1,B=0) to the state (A=0,B=2).\n\nQuantitative, Quantitative, Regulations, Correlations:\nExplicit quantitative report. Two reports are available, one for the \"all\" selection and one for the \"selected\" selection. Pick them in the top panel list to display / compare. The content is as detailed in the article."
